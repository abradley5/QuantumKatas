    "This tutorial introduces you to single-qubit gates. Quantum gates are the quantum counterpart to classical logic gates, acting as the building blocks of quantum algorithms. Quantum gates transform qubit states in various ways, and can be applied sequentially to perform complex quantum calculations. Single-qubit gates, as their name implies, act on individual qubits. You can learn more at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate).\n",

    "The following cell contains code demonstrating how to apply gates in Q#, using the Pauli $X$ gate as an example. It sets up a series of quantum states, and then shows the result of applying the $X$ gate to each one. To run the demo, run the next cell using `Ctrl+Enter` (`⌘+Enter` on a Mac).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial we discussed that the qubit state in Q# cannot be directly assigned or accessed. The same logic is extended to the quantum gates: applying a gate to a qubit modifies the internal state of that qubit but doesn't return the resulting state of the qubit. This is why we never assign the output of these gates to any variables in this demo - they don't produce any output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying several gates in a row follows the same principle. In the mathematical notation applying an $X$ gate followed by a $Z$ gate to a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is denoted as $Z(X(|\\psi\\rangle))$, because the result of applying a gate to a state is another state. In Q#, applying a gate doesn't return anything, so you can't use its output as an input to another gate - something like `Z(X(q))` will not produce expected result. Instead, to apply several gates to the same qubit, you need to call them separately in the order in which they are applied:\n",

    "\n",
    "The next few gates are parametrized: their exact behavior depends on a numeric parameter - an angle $\\theta$, given in radians. \n",
    "These gates are the $X$ rotation gate $R_x(\\theta)$, $Y$ rotation gate $R_y(\\theta)$, $Z$ rotation gate $R_z(\\theta)$, and the arbitrary phase gate $R_1(\\theta)$. \n",
    "Note that for the first three gates the parameter $\\theta$ is multiplied by $\\frac{1}{2}$ within the gate's matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "> These gates are known as rotation gates, because they represent rotations around various axes on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way of representing the qubit states visually, mapping them onto the surface of a sphere. \n",
    "> Unfortunately, this visualization isn't very useful beyond single-qubit states, which is why we have opted not to go into details in this tutorial series. \n",
    "> If you are curious about it, you can learn more in [this slide deck](http://www.vcpc.univie.ac.at/~ian/hotlist/qc/talks/bloch-sphere.pdf) or in [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere).\n",
